UI:

- [ ] Bucket UI
    - [ ] view/create/select buckets
        - table view, paginated
    - [ ] Selected bucket -> view files
        - table view, paginated
        - CRUD on files
    - [ ] Rudimentary search
        - Little more than "filename like X" and "bucket name like X"

Some progress. Major remaining TODOs:

- authenticate user
- bucket permissions?
    - via roles, or user-groups
- database migrations via dbmate
- autogenerated docs?

Started session authentication, need tables added to database. Until database
migrations are added, easiest to add to init and run SQL manually.

Remaning @ session authentication:
- decorator to check session auth
    - relies on session cookie, already done

Session authentication finished. Began working on frontend, decided to try out
htmx (it's hip!) as I still suck at javascript.

So far, liking it a lot. Currently, it's only used for "login" and "logout" at
navigation. "Login" page is a full site reload, losing the point of htmx. I'd
like to keep htmx components small, but ugly as I don't like them referencing
outside of their immediate scope in the DOM. Need to think more about approach:
Either include navbar @ index or accept what I deem ugly.
